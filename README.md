## About Me

Hello everyone! My name is James Asedo and I'm learning how to code. I retired from the Air Force in September of 2021 after 21 years of active duty service. I am currently employed as a mortgage loan originator but am looking to pivot into IT. I have always had an interest in IT and wanted to learn how to code. 

My goals for this course are:
* Expand my skills and learn how to code.
* Learn how to create a website.
* Network with professionals in IT.
* And lastly, obtain a satisfying and challenging career in IT.
